%ImageNet: 1000 classes, 80 breeds of dogs

Classification gets ``harder'' when we
\begin{itemize}
\item add more classes
\item the classes are ``more similar''
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in}
This talk:
\begin{itemize}
\item formalize ``harder'' (machine learning)
\item formalize ``more similar'' (discrete geometry)
\item fix the problem
\end{itemize}
